# Employee Manager

Database interface that will be able to create,display, and alter employee data

## Installation

run an npm install

```bash
npm i 
```

## Usage

Help to keep up with employee data.
## Future Dev
I want to build this out so that you can alter every part of the employee. The ability to search for one person would be nice. I would also like to build in some filtering with sql syntax.
